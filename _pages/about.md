I am a researcher at Tencent working on reinforcement learning, LLMs and agents, AutoML, and neural compression for efficient deployment. I lead applied research on multi-scale pretraining and mid-training across small language models (SLMs) and large language models (LLMs) over text, audio, and other modalities, with a strong focus on post-training (on-policy distillation, RLVR) and agentic RL.

Recent highlights include leading the Tinytron team to 1st place in the NeurIPS 2024 Edge-Device LLM competition (model compression & pretrain tracks) and the TEG-AutoML team to 2nd place in the NeurIPS 2022 AutoML Decathlon. I collaborate on AIGC in gaming and open RL platforms for education and research.
