I have been a researcher at Tencent since 2022, after receiving my Master of Science degree from the School of Electronic and Computer Engineering ([SECE](https://www.ece.pku.edu.cn/)) at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My most recent work focuses on post-training covering on-policy distillation, RLVR, and agentic reinforcement learning. Prior to and in parallel with this, I have led research on from-scratch and continual pretraining of both small and large language models across text, speech, and image modalities. I also collaborate on AI agents for games and on developing reinforcement-learning platforms for education and research.
