Lvfang Tao has been a researcher at Tencent since 2022, after receiving his Master of Science degree from the [School of Electronic and Computer Engineering (SECE)](https://www.ece.pku.edu.cn/) at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). His most recent work focuses on mid-training and post-training for large language models, including synthetic data, on-policy distillation, RLVR, and agentic reinforcement learning. Since 2019, he has led projects on from-scratch and continual pretraining of both small and large language models across text, speech, and image modalities. He is also a core contributor to the reinforcement-learning platform [AI Arena](https://aiarena.tencent.com/aiarena/en/), which serves the education and research community as well as game developers.


陶履方，2022 年毕业于北京大学信息工程学院并获得理学硕士学位，同年加入腾讯担任算法研究员。作为 [腾讯开悟平台](https://aiarena.tencent.com/aiarena/zh/) 算法方向的核心贡献者，研究方向包括强化学习环境、智能体与平台系统。近期工作主要围绕大模型的中训练与后训练阶段，主导项目涵盖合成数据、on-policy 蒸馏、RLVR、Tool-Use / Agentic RL 等技术方向，相关成果已在公开竞赛与内部产品中得到验证。自 2019 年起，在文本、语音和图像等模态上积累了大规模预训练与增量预训练的经验。
